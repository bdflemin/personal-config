# personal-config
configs needed for zsh, brew or other services when needed

Currently looking for the following configs

* brew casks
* vimrc
* zprezto (alternative to oh-my-zsh)

most of the configs are `cp` options into the profile but the `brew` part will need ot be done doing the following:

```
xargs brew install < my-casks.txt
```
